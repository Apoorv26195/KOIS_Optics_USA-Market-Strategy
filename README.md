# KOIS_Optics_USA-Market-Strategy
We were assigned a project to build a market strategy to introduce the Greek fashion eye-wear brand KOIS Optics to the US Market. It was a group project where I performed the Market Research, identified the 4 Ps in detail, formed an in-depth promotion strategy and desgined a couple of interactive ads along with the suggested home-page wireframe.
Please refer to the pdf to access the full pitch proposed for launch in the US Market.
